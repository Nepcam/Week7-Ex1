# Week7-Ex1
Working on methods 

Write a simple Chess game, which has a board made up of alternating coloured squares, and two sets
of coloured pieces. For this exercise we will create the board of alternating coloured squares. The exercise will not
involve interacting with the chess pieces at all. The user should be able to specify the size of the board, that value is used to
specify the number of rows and columns of the board. For example if the user enters the value "8", the board will have 8 rows
and 8 columns.
